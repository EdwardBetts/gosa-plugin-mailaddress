# Simple plugin to manage user mail addresses in GOsa²

This plugin is a very light-weighted version of the GOsa² mail plugin.
Whereas gosa-plugin-mail can be used to manage a complete mail server
farm, this tiny plugin only provides means to modify the user's mail
address via a text field.

This plugin is useful for people that need to maintain users' email
addresses via GOsa², but do not run their own mailserver(s).

GOsa² is a combination of system-administrator and end-user web
interface, designed to handle LDAP based setups.

The mail address plugin is licensed under GPL-2+. For further details,
please check the AUTHORS.txt and COPYING files.
